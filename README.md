# Youtube-to-Anghami-Playlist
Convert your Youtube playlist to an Anghami one!

This script transfers an Youtube playlist to an Anghami playlist
To get this wroking you need fill in the variables below with:
1. playlist ID
2. your youtube API key
3. your Anghami api key

## It is also _VERY IMPORTANT_ TO CREATE A PLAYLIST IN ANGHAMI NAMED "Youtube" (case-sensitive)
##The playlist is limited to 50 songs

## THIS SCRIPT IS NOT PERFECT
## IT DOES NOT VALIDATE THE SONGS BEFORE ADDING THEM - SO IT COULD ADD THE WRONG SONG
Things to improve would be:
- refining search even more (utilize artist name for instance), as it stands this script trys to clean video titles from irrelevant info but is not prefect (it removes phrases like "Official Music Video", "Audio", etc...).
- valdiating the right song is added and not just a similar title.
